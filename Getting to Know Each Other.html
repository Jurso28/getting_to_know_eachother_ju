<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Joe Urso, and I am in the final semester of my undergraduate. I currently work for Microsoft on their retail side and will be taking a corporate role with them in August where the location could have me moving to New York. I live with my parents and dog in Villa Park. Both of my parents are big inspirations of mine as they are hardworking individuals that have allowed for me to have an incredible life. I hope to take a lot of their qualities when I move out on my own and start my own family. My major is Computer Science and I have applied for graduate school in Computer Science with a concentration in Cybersecurity. I hope to one day work as a Security Technical Specialist within Microsoft and display high levels of knowledge for our Enterprise customers.</p>
<h2>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I hope to learn how an actual scrum team works</li>
  <li>I hope to learn how to market an end product</li>
  <li>I want to learn how to gather user data to implement desired features</li>
</ul>
<h2>My Favorite Hobby/Activity</h2>
<p>My favorite hobby is going to sporting events, particularly pro wrestling events. At time of writing this I just went to a show where I met a bunch of legends that have performed across the world.</p>
<h2>Fun Fact</h2>
<p>A fun fact about me is that I graduated High School in 3 years and immediately entered college.</p>
